# Enterprise Mobile AppDev Workshop
 
Workshop for enterprise enabled modern application development

## General information

This repository is designed to be working as template for graphback command line client.
`./template` folder will contain graphback server template used to initialize project.
`./template/client` contains react application that can be used to contact server

Please reffer to each individual `stepX` branch for individual steps for this tutorial

## Introduction

This workshop focused on deploying fully functional webapplication server using 

- Node.js server 
- React.js Client PWA application

Workshop was divided into following sections:

- Creating Server side using Graphback client
- Reviewing React Based client implementatiomn
- Implementing offline support and conflict handling for client and server

### Prerequisites

- Node.js LTS 10 
- Docker and docker-compose
- Visual Studio Code (or other IDE)

### 1) Bulding your first GraphQL server using AeroGear GraphBack

GraphBack command line tool (https://graphback.dev) allows developers 
to generate fully functional Node.js based server that will be offering 
GraphQL API out of the box based on developer provided business model.
In this chapter we going to build sample Task application that will
be based on custom server template we have provided.

Example server contains following technologies:

- AeroGear Voyager Server (including audit log, etrics and keycloak integration)
- Postgres database
- Apollo GraphQL server (Express.js based)

#### Steps

1. Install graphback client

```
 npm install -g graphback-cli
```

2. Create new project based on template

```
graphback init node-workshop ---templateUrl=https://github.com/aerogear/modern-appdev-workshop
```

In cmd please answer questions as follows:
```
? Do you want to include a example model? No
? Choose your database PostgreSQL
```

3. Change directory into project folder

```
cd node-workshop
```

4. Review the `Task.graphql` file inside `model` with your GraphQL types.
This file was added as part of the template. GraphBack allows you to 
provide your own business logic, but for this example we going use predefined 
one.

5. Subscriptions are used in GraphQL to enable live updates of information. Graphback can help with subscriptions.
Open `config.json` in the root of the directory and enable the `subCreate` flag.
```
 "subCreate": true,
```
This flag is used to tell graphback that we would like to generate the Subscriptions.
This particular flag generates them only when a schema type is created.

6. Run `graphback generate` to generate schema and resolvers

7. Run `docker-compose up -d` to run your database
   and `graphback db` to create database resources in postgres

8. Run `graphback watch` to start the server and watch for changes
   in model.

9. Server will be ready at http://localhost:4000/graphql

10. Server offers playground as way to interact with it's API.
It is loaded with example queries that can be used to access data
through playground and execute GraphQL queries - createTask, updateTask etc.

### 2) Bulding Your first GraphQL Client with React, GraphQL and AeroGear DataSync

Server side template comes with client folder that will contain React.js 
project boilerplate. We have initialized project using create-react-app
and applied following projects

- React.js TypeScript template
- *AeroGear Voyager Client* that will offer *Data Synchronization* and 
*Conflict resolution*.
- *Uniforms* - Library for building GraphQL forms based on GraphQL schema.

#### Steps

1. Install required dependencies for the project

```
npm install 
```

2. Run project

```
npm run start 
```

3. At this point we should see web application connecting with server and 
using autogenerated api. Create Task operation is still not implemented.
We going to focus on that in the next chapter of the tutorial

## 3) Implementing offline and conflict resolution

TODO

## 4) Deployment to OpenShift

### Prerequisites

* Create an account on [Dockerhub](https://hub.docker.com/)

An OpenShift template is provided to deploy the backend server on OpenShift.

### Steps

1. Log in to the Dockerhub Registry

```bash
docker login
```

2. Build the application into a docker image.

```bash
docker build -t <dockerhubusername>/<imagename>:latest . # ex: docker build -t aerogear/graphback-demo:latest .
```

3. Push the image to Dockerhub

```bash
docker push <dockerhubusername>/<imagename>:latest
```

4. Create the OpenShift template in a namespace of your choice

```bash
oc process -f openshift-template.yml --param APPLICATION_IMAGE=<dockerhubusername>/<imagename>:latest | oc create -f -
```

### Cleanup

```bash
oc process -f openshift-template.yml --param APPLICATION_IMAGE=<dockerhubusername>/<imagename>:latest | oc delete -f -
```

## 4) Enabling Auth Service (Keycloak) for application
